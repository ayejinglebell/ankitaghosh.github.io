										work fordifferent roles in a short period of time. This was 
										possible solely because I worked in a environment where I
										was expected to write the codes, debug them and do handson
										with Vehicle on a Test track. I felt I was in a startup even

										company.</p>

									<p>I have worked with some seniors with over 15 years of experience 
										and some who joined with me. And I have been humbled by both 
										because technology is never biased. Computers is something 
										I have been curious about since I was 12 years old. Now in the 
										industry this passion remains with me. There is so much to learn, 
										so much to discover, and yet more to learn and build. 
										I have been gratified.</p>

							<h2>What am I passionate about?</h2>
							<p>The Evolving Technology.</p>
						</header>
						<p>I have been curious about Computers since I was 10 years old.
							As my school started teaching basic Computers. HTML, C and C++.
							I took Computer Science as my Higher Secondary Elective subject.
							I took Electrical as my undergraduate degree where I learnt
							a lot about machines, computational mathematics etc. I was 
							not par with many subjects taught in the main Computer Science 
							degree so I became self learner. I am still learning and will 
							continue to do so. 
							Coding and the analytical thinking to relate basic concepts
							between different domains has been my strength.
							I was noticed because of this when I joined my first job And
							I was able to do get into Advanced Engineering.
